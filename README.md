# Cloudy Tic-Tac-Toe

A game of tic-tac-toe that will be a real-world app which uses cloud-based services.

## 1. Idea

I had an Idea for 2024. I want to make a "real world" app for the various app stores - but do it in such a way that I
can learn about new things. I work on .NET MAUI so I know some XAML and C# ;) but my cloud and backend skills are not
so amazing.

This is a new series where I am hoping to make a simple app - 1 or 2 player tic-tac-toe game - and build it with a
backend in mind. I have no idea what I will use or what I will do, but I have some goals:

1. Focus on the backend
2. Track analytics and crashes
3. Support authenticated users for those score-conscious people
4. Support game results for leaderboards or  some "advanced player metrics"
5. Use XAML for the mobile/desktop app
6. Use Blazor WASM for the web version
7. Learn
8. Have fun
9. Make sure there are tests: unit tests, device tests and UI tests
10. Maybe some ads for that sweet cash (jk, to see how a real app developer would want to do this)
11. Some remote config or A/B testing for the advanced/new features
12. Push notifications
13. Cloud, stateless functions
14. Beta testers
15. Website for the landing pages and various other "docs"
16. Maybe some AI/ML for player suggestions
17. Track all the dev like a real app in GitHub: https://github.com/mattleibow/CloudyTicTacToe

There is a lot in the list above, but it really is a small list for things to make a fun and engaging app, but be able
to learn from players and to make decisions for future development.

## 2. First lines

To get started quickly, I am planning on making a simple random-place computer player so I can start focusing on the
cloud aspects.

Project board: https://github.com/users/mattleibow/projects/2/views/1

I am planning on a simple navigation:

1. Landing page with a Play button that goes to Game screen
2. Game screen
3. Game results pop-over with a New Game button to screen 2 or Exit to screen 1
